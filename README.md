**<ins>AI Flower Classification & Generation</ins>**

**Hello!** My names Kerisa and this is a project my partner Jonathan Moore and I worked on for Pace University's **Artificial Intelligence Internship Experience!**

In order to complete this final project we:

  * Implemented **deep learning** techniques to identify, sort, and generate Al-generated images of flowers by training a **neural network** with thousands of flower images, enhancing model accuracy and performance.
  * Utilized Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas to preprocess datasets, manage data structures, and streamline workflow for efficient model development.
  * Collaborated with a team using **Agile methodology**, including **scrumming and parallel programming**, to complete the final project and deliver a polished presentation.
  * Leveraged Google Colab and Visual Studio Code for coding, testing, and debugging, ensuring smooth integration of tools and effective project execution
