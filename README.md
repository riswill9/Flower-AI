# TomAndJerry-AI
## AI classification - is it Tom or Jerry?

### Project created for Pace Universitys Artificial Intelligence Internship Experience
In this project we explore concepts within vast topics such as Deep Learning - Facial/Pattern Recognition & Classification
  * Python and its elusive libraries { NumPy, Panda, PyTorch, Pillow } were used,
      -  as well as JPG Datasets { 5k+ Images } drawn from Kaggle.com
      -  into Visual Studio Code to create an AI that will classify photos into whether they are Tom or Jerry.
